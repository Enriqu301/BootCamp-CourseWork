# ACC Software Bootcamp - Assesment #1

</center>

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1.  Git clone this `Students_<YOUR-COHORT>_Reviews` repository to your computer, within your "Bootcamp" folder. 
    - You can run the command `ls -a` to ensure you are not currently in a repository (you would see a `.git` folder). You should not clone a repository within a repository since that will cause issues pushing your work up. Find a more appropriate place to clone if that is the case.

2.  Copy the `01_assessment` folder over to your ACCSoftwareBootcamp repo, so you can edit the contents there and commit/push them for grading.

    For example, get the questions from

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/Students_<YOUR-COHORT>_Reviews/01_assesment`

    And push your answers to

    `github.com/ACCSoftwareBootcamp/<YOUR_REPO>/01_assesment`

3.  There's a folder for each question. Please write your answers within the respective folder's `solution.js` file. You are welcome to create more files and folders to support or confirm your answers.

4.  This review is in 2 parts

    1. **Section 1: Multiple choice questions**. 25% of the credit. Please choose one best answer from the provided Google Form.

    2. **Section 2: Small practical questions**. 75% of the credit.

5.  This review is open book. You may use all references available to you to answer the questions. You may ask instructors/mentors to point you in the right direction, if you are stuck. Think of this as a typical work environment, where you may ask a mentor to show you the way, but not do the work for you. Do not ask another student. You may not search for answers to the exact Codewars problem. 

6.  To make sure you have enough time to attempt all of the questions, return to the difficult ones later. They are not numbered in any particular order.

7. You may write your solution directly in the Codewars IDE and copy/paste your solution over to the corresponding `solution.js` file. 

7.  Please `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` your answers to your private ACCSoftwareBootcamp repository only. Do so as often as you wish, to make sure your answers are backed-up to github.com.

## TIME AVAILABLE

1. You will have from 9am to 1pm to complete the exam. Only the last commit before 1pm will be considered for grading.

2. Many students are able to complete the exam within the 4 hour class. With that said, do try taking breaks.

## INTEGRITY:

Remember this review is a test of how well prepared you are. You need an honest answer. Try to satisfy the spirit of the review. While some of the questions may appear difficult, they CAN be answered with some amount of research and thinking. It is more important to learn from this experience, than to bypass it. As such, here are some ground rules

- No sharing of direct or indirect answers, between students.
- Absolutely no sharing of answer code.
- Absolutely no sharing of screens.
- No sharing of url references, your peers can web search too ;-).
- Any clarification from instructors should be posted on Slack under the channel **#assessments** such that all students have access to the same clarification.

## EVALUATION

1. 70% of overall score is needed for being considered as successful.

2. All Codewars problems will be graded by the number of tests each solution passes. 
Example: 
Your solution passes 67 out of 67 tests ----> 100%

Your solution passes 1 out of 2 tests -----> 50%

3. All solutions must have comments explaining what the code does.

4. There are 2 extra credit questions. You are not expected to complete these but do give them a try!
