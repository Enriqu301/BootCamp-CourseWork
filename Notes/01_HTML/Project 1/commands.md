1. On your desktop, create a folder named “soups”.
    mkdir soups
2. Go inside of your soups folder. Create a file called “ChickenNoodle.html” and “BakedPotato.css”
    cd soups
    touch ChickenNoodle.html
    touch BakedPotato.css
3. While you are inside of the soups folder, create another folder called “js”.
    mkdir js
4. Go inside of the js folder.
    cd js
5. Where are we? Display the current path that we are on.
    soups/js
6. Now go back 'up' to the soups folder.
    cd ..
7. Create a file called “CreamyTomato.js” and put it in the js folder while still in the soups folder.
    touch CreamyTomato.js mv js
8. Create a file called “readme.txt.” in the soups folder.
    touch readme.txt
9. On second thought, maybe we do not need a readme file right. Delete “readme.txt”.
    rm readme.txt
10. Go into the js folder.
    cd js
11. You decide you are not in the mood for creamy tomato. Rename “CreamyTomato.js” to “BroccoliCheddar.js”.
    mv CreamyTomato.js BroccoliCheddar.js
