Steps:

Go through the steps of creating a new application with express.js and EJS installed
Have a views folder and a partials folder
The partials folder should contain two files: header.ejs and footer.ejs
The header.ejs file should contain the top part of your HTML code, including the nav bar
The footer.ejsâ€™ file should contain the bottom part of your HTML code, including the footer links
You will also have three other files: home.ejs, about.ejs, and contact.ejs.
Use bootstrap for styling. Use the jumbotron and breadcrumb classes for creating the body and footer.
