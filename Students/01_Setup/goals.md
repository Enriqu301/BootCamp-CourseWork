<br>

We will cover this in depth during class, but keep in mind there are many ways of communicating.

Not only amongst ourselves, but also with our tools and resources. 

When in doubt, ask it on Slack - #general channel

## <center>StackOverflow</center>
#### <a id='subRead2' href="#_readings"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

One of the benefits of this bootcamp is learning how to ask the right questions.

Many times, in our heads, we know what we want to do but we do not necessaily know the correct words or syntax to use.

For instance: what if you needed more info on how to send a form?

Doing a Google search will return different results based on how you word this. The following may look similar BUT they they are actually asking different questions.

    'how to send a form'
    'how to send a form using HTML'
    'how to send a form to server'
    'how to send data with a form to a server'
    'how to build a form in HTML'
    'what attributes needed to send HTML form'

Keep in mind that your first search may not return the results you wanted. As you progess through this bootcamp
you will learn how to fine tune your searches based on new concepts, jargon, syntax, etc...

One of the most often found results online is from a site called StackOverflow (SO).

Not everything posted on SO is true or accurate.  There is so much that is not accurate that as a student you might sometimes feel lost.  

What are the options before you?  

Some ideas might include .. 

### **SO ratings:**

Take a look at the rating of each answer. The highest rated answers are generally the first answers shown.

It has to exceed a certain threshold before you believe it implicitly. If it has a high rating, then chances are it will lead you down the right path. 

A lower rating means you may have to do further research. However, it could be a new question so not many people have answered it.

You decide if you believe it.  If you don't, feel free to do more research.

###  **Compare what you know with what you read:**

Take notes of everything you learn, so you can quickly compare between what you have learned and what you are reading right now.  

Use a consistent place to put all your **Lessons Learned** and syntax of each command you learned. 

Comment in your code, hand write notes, create a separate directory with your work and notes, or anything that works for you.

<b>Evernote</b> is quite generous with its free offer and works on most devices, even the browser.  

If using Evernote, install the browser extension, so you can save pages that you really like.

## <center>Project #1: Set up Online Accounts</center>
#### <a id='project1' href="#_projects"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

## Online accounts
  
  - Github.com : you should have already done this by now.
  - LinkedIn : if you don't have a LI account, start one and start building it.  See Job Search section below for some tips.  We shall discuss this more later in this program.
  - Slack.com 
    - Setup Slack client on your desktop (both Windows and Linux if you have both)
    - Setup Slack client on your phone
    - Review functionality.  You may ask for help from slackbot. Try it with `/help`
    - What channels are there?  What are they for? 
    - Direct messaging and 1-to-many direct messaging.  Try it with one or multiple class mate or instructors.
    - Direct message yourself about any reminders to yourself.
    - Try threaded conversations to avoid clutter.  Look for a chat symbol on a message.
    - Have fun with emoji's. Emoji's are preferred as they reduce messages and adequately express the feeling or response.

## <center>Project #2: Linux Environment Setup</center>
#### <a id='project2' href="#_projects"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

NOTE: If you are on a Apple OSX machine, you can skip this project. 

If you are on Windows 10, please setup Windows Subsystem Ubuntu 18.04 Linux on your machine.

Install Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on Your Windows 10 machine (10 min).  This is meant for those that wish to stay with Windows 10.  

You can have a bit of both worlds, Windows and Linux.  Ask for instructor help if necessary.

## <center>Project #3: App Installations</center>
#### <a id='project3' href="#_projects"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

Many of the apps used in class are to make your lives easier as developers. Feel free to download the following ahead of time as they will save time in class:

1. ***Chrome browser*** : if you don't have Chrome, please install it from Google Chrome's website. Many of the dev tools we use are built in to Chrome or can be installed as extensions.

    You may use other browsers BUT there is no guarantee they will have the tools needed for development.

1. ***VSCode (editor)*** [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

    One of the great benefits of VSC are the extensions we can install to make writing code faster and more efficient.

    You can install any extension you want, but the following are the best to get started:

    1. ***Bracket Pair Colorizer*** by CoenraadS

        Keep track of your brackets and reduce the amount of time searching for that one bracket you forgot that is breaking your app.

    1. ***Highlight Bad Chars*** by Kevin Wenger

        When copying and pasting code, sometimes there are 'hidden' characters underneath that can break your code. This extension helps find and remove them.
    1. ***HTML Preview*** by Thomas Haakon 
    Townsend

        Allows you to preview what your HTML will look like without having to open a browser

    1. ***Indent-Rainbow*** by oderwat

        Indenting is very important for humen-legible coding. This extension helps indicate proper indentation.

    1. ***Live Server*** by Ritwick Dey

        Allows you to automatically open your file in a broswer and see changes as you make them.

    Make sure to check out the various color themes and icons you can use. Remember, you will be sitting in front of your computer for hours at a time - make it enjoyable!

1. ***Git Command Line*** 

    NOTE: Everyone - DO NOT install the Github Desktop, Atlassian Sourcetree or any other Git client just yet.  We only need the <u>command line version</u> for now.  

    NOTE: This is pre-installed on Macs. Those with Macs can skip

    **Windows 10**:

      Please check if git comes with your computer using the command in your command prompt:

    ```git --version```

      If it is installed, it would provide a version.

      If not installed, your options depend upon using WSL Ubuntu Linux (see above) or not.  Choose the appropriate installation instructions at the site below for your system.
