<br>

All tasks will be done with one HTML and one CSS file.

Answer the questions as comments inside your CSS file.

Create a parent folder called `Project1`.

Inside the parent folder you will have an `assets` folder, an `index.html` file, and a `style.css` file.

Task #1 - Selectors

1. Create an `h1` tag with a class of `cat` and an id of `dog`.
1. Add some content.
1. Using the tag, add a solid red border of 5px
1. Using the class, change the background color to black
1. Using the id, change the content color to white
1. How does this look in your browser?

Task #2 - Selectors

1. Create another `h1` tag, this time with a class of `cat` and an id of `mouse`.
1. Add some content.
1. Look at your browser. What do you notice? Why?
1. Using the id, change the content color to yellow.
1. Change the border color to blue, dashed and 5px.

Task #3 - Selectors

1. Create another `h1` tag, this time with a class of `cat` and an id of `bird`.
1. Add some content.
1. Look at your browser. What do you notice? Why?
1. Using the id, change the content color to lightgreen.
1. Change the border so it has a color of green ridged and 5px;

Task #4 - Width

1. Add a width of 25% to your first h1.
1. Add a width of 200px to your second h1.
1. Add a width of 50 viewer width (vw) to third h1.
1. Resize your browser.
1. What do you notice? What are the differences between %, px, and vw? Why are they important?

Task #5 - Text

1. Using your first h1, align your text so it is centered.
1. Using your third h1, align the text so it is on the right.

Task #6 - Margin

1. Using margin, center the first h1 in the middle of your screen.
1. Using margin, center the third h1 in the middle of your screen and add a top margin of 100 pixels and bottom of 0 pixels.
1. Create a fourth `h1` tag, this time with a class of `cat` and an id of `horse`.
1. Add some content with an orange color.
1. Using margin, center the fourth h1 in the middle of the screen.
1. What happened? Why? How do you fix so you can center it?

Task #7 - Padding

1. Add 100px padding to all sides of content in your first h1 (do not use shorthand).
1. Add 100px of padding to the right-side ONLY in your second h1 (do not use shorthand).
1. Add 100px of padding to the right-side and bottom ONLY in your third h1 (do not use shorthand).
1. Using the padding shorthand, add 100px padding to top and left in your fourth h1.

At this point, you should see something like this in your browser:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./project_assets/project_1/Screen1.png" width=75%>
</p>

Comment out your h1 tags.

Task #8 - Images and Inline Elements

1. Add the following image to your assets folder: [code image](./project_assets/project_1/computer-code.jpeg)
1. Add an image tag to your `index.html` linked to the image you added to your assets folder.
1. What happened???
1. Add a width of 50%.
1. Using margin, center the image in the middle of screen.
1. What happened? Why? (HINT: research inline versus block elements)
1. Add a div tag and move your image tag into the div
1. Add a border to the div. 
1. What do you notice?
1. Add a width of 25% to your div.
1. What is happening ot the image inside?
1. Comment out the width of your image.
1. Notice the border in comparison to your image?
1. Uncomment your width of the image and change to 100%.
1. Look better?
1. Notice the small white space under the image. Why is this happening?

Task #9 - Images, Margin and Padding

1. Add a height of 300px to your div.
1. Add a height of 100% to your image.

1. Add ids to each of the elements: `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4`
1. Add `changeFont` as a class to each of the elements.
1. Using tag and class combination, change the color of all the content to darkblue
1. Using the id, change the color of the third `p` tag content to red.
1. Why did the other elements NOT change color?
1. Add the following after all the other `p` tag styling:  `p { color: green}`
1. Anything happen? Why or why not?
1. Change the styling in #9 to `p.changeFont { color: green}`.
1. What happened to the third element? Why did it not change?

At this point, you should see something like this in your browser:
<p align="center"><img src="./project_assets/project_1/Screen2.png" width=75%></p>

#### <a id='project3' href="#_projects"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

Who is [Piet Mondrian](https://www.artsy.net/artist/piet-mondrian)?

Your challenge is to recreate the Mondrian-inspired image below using given starter code for HTML, and do ALL styling with CSS. 

Try to duplicate as close as you can. Your results will not be perfect but should be close.

This is to give you a better understanding of positioning.

Ready?

Inside the body, please use this HTML. Do not add to it nor alter in any way:

      <body>
        <div>1</div>
        <div>2</div>
        <div>3</div>
        <div>4</div>
        <div>5</div>
        <div>6</div>
        <div>7</div>
        <div>8</div>
        <div>9</div>
        <div><p>Your Name</p></div>
      </body>

Use google fonts - `Mansalva`.

You should be able to do this with postioning, borders, and background colors.
