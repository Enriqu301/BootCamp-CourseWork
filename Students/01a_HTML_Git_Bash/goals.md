# <center>Readings

## <center>Command Line Interface</center>
#### <a id='subRead1' href="#_readings"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

Most of our learning of Command Line Interface (CLI) will be done in class and reinforced with projects 1 -3.

<hr>

## <center>HTML</center>
#### <a id='subRead2' href="#_readings"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

Most of our HTML learning will be done in class and through the CodeVox tutorials with reinforcement through projects 4 -6.

Project #7 is a bonus project if you would like to keep practicing.

Lastly, one of the most overlooked aspects of HTML is validation. Most students skip this part of development.

When writing HTML, please run validation on it. You can use the W3C Markup Validation Service online [here](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_upload)
  
Another decent validator is a Chrome extension called HTML Validator.  Once enabled, it shows your mistakes in the Validator tab in Dev Tools. You may find the plugin [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/html-validator/mpbelhhnfhfjnaehkcnnaknldmnocglk?hl=en-US).

## <center>Project #1: Command Line</center>
#### <a id='project1' href="#_projects"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

The goal of this project is to get you familiar with how to use the CLI.

1. Create a file called `commands.md`

    You can paste your queries into the file and submit to Github. You will not be submittiing anything else.

1. Perform the following using your CLI - NO GUI!!:
    1. On your desktop, create a folder named “soups”.
    1. Go inside of your soups folder. Create a file called “ChickenNoodle.html” and “BakedPotato.css”
    1. While you are inside of the soups folder, create another folder called “js”.
    1. Go inside of the js folder. 
    1. Where are we? Display the current path that we are on.
    1. Now go back 'up' to the soups folder.
    1. Create a file called “CreamyTomato.js” and put it in the js folder while still in the soups folder.
    1. Create a file called “readme.txt.” in the soups folder.
    1. On second thought, maybe we do not need a readme file right. Delete “readme.txt”.
    1. Go into the js folder.
    1. You decide you are not in the mood for creamy tomato. Rename “CreamyTomato.js” to “BroccoliCheddar.js”.
    
**You’re done!**

## <center>Project #2: Command Line - part 2</center>
#### <a id='project2' href="#_projects"> (back to top)</a>
<br>

This project will build on what you learned from Project 1.

<b>Note:</b> for this project, you cannot use the “cd” command at all once you are in the desktop path. Do everything from the desktop path of your command line.

1. Create a file called `commands2.md`

    You can paste your queries into the file and submit to Github. You will not be submittiing anything else.

1. Perform the following using your CLI - NO GUI!!:

    1. On your desktop, create a folder called “drinks”.
    1. Inside of drinks, create three folders: Smoothies, FrozenDrinks and IcedSpecialtyDrinks.
    1. Rename the “Smoothies” folder to “PowerSmoothies”.
    1. Inside of PowerSmoothies, create three files: 
        1. PeachAndBlueberry.txt, 
        2. GreenPassion.txt, and 
        3. Superfruit.txt.
    1. Inside of FrozenDrinks, create three files: 
        1. WatermelonStrawberryLemonade.html, 
        2. Caramel.html, and 
        3. Mocha.html.
    1. Inside of IcedSpecialityDrinks, create four files: 
        1. CaramelLatte.css, 
        2. ChaiTeaLatte.css, 
        3. CaffeMocha.css 
        4. CaffeLatte.css.
    1. Delete CaffeLatte.css. 

That’s enough caffeine for today!
